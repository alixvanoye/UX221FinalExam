npm run dev

This will continuously deploy on gh-pages using the [diy-pwa/npm-build-2-gh-pages@v1.11](https://github.com/diy-pwa/npm-build-2-gh-pages) plugin. You can also deploy on a cloud provider by running `npm run build`. Your static site will be in the `dist/` folder.

Update README.md to trigger a build.
